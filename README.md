### Problem Statement  
When the COVID-19 pandemic is running rampant, current information is paramount for staying safe. Graphs and models are created daily, producing figures relied on by hospitals and government agencies. Although this data is official, it does not tell the entire story of outbreak impact. On social media, specifically Twitter, people are talking about their experience with COVID-19.  
  
As a team of data scientists working for the CDC, we are tasked with creating a model that can dynamically classify Tweets as COVID-related. To solve this unsupervised learning problem we will train a w2v vectorizer on COVID-19 related tweets and use the weights of those words in a DBscan cluster. We will then check the Tweet clusters to assess relationships, and determine which clusters are our targets.  
  
### Executive Summary  
Our data was pulled from Twitter using the twitterscraper Python library and a custom wrapper function. We prepared two datasets separately, one with is
